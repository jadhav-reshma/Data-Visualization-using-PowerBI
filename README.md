# Data-Visualization-using-PowerBI
This is a Data Visualization Project Using Power BI
The major focus is on data visualization and collecting different insights from it.

### Dataset
For this project a superstore's sales data is used. this dataset contains around 51,000 rows & 24 columns. dataset is in 'xlxs' format and the same spreadsheet is attched.

This dataset contains 3 spreadsheets.

1. orders

2. returns

3. people

### Project Steps

* Setp1- Getting datset and importing it to Power BI

* Step2- Performed various DAX and Power Query methods for data cleaning.

* Step3- DAX and Power Query Methods Used:


       1. Chaging columns names
       2. 2.reordering columns
       3. Changed data types of columns
       4. column flitration
       5. Adding coustom columns to seprate year from order date
       6. Replced Vales( Catagorical Values)
       7. Dropped Unwanted columns
       8. Dealth with missing/null values
       
* Step4 - Dashboard/Report Creation:

       - Slicer is used to get data for respective year.
       - Crads are used to get sum of prfit,quantity,return orders & avgrage delivery days.
       - Donut Charts are used for sales reprentation by sales and market.
